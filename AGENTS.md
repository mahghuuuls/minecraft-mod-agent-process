# Agent Instructions

This repository provides a reusable process for developing one Minecraft 1.12.2 mod at a time with AI agents.

Agents using this repository in a mod-development workspace must guide the mod project. They must not update this process repository as part of that work.

## Fixed Scope

This workflow is only for Minecraft 1.12.2 mod development.

The selected mod loader, runtime compatibility target, template, and distribution platforms are project decisions handled by Project Setup and later stages. However, the Minecraft version itself is not a project variable in this workflow.

Agents must not:

- Plan, research, or implement for Minecraft versions other than 1.12.2.
- Generalize guidance from newer Minecraft versions unless it is explicitly verified as applicable to 1.12.2.
- Suggest upgrading the mod to a newer Minecraft version as part of this workflow.
- Treat requests for other Minecraft versions as normal configuration changes.

If the owner asks to target a different Minecraft version, explain that it is outside this workflow's scope. Record the request in `workspace/documentation/workflow-feedback.md` if it suggests a future process change, but continue this workflow only for Minecraft 1.12.2.

## Operating Scope

Use this repository for Minecraft 1.12.2 mod development only.

During a mod project, the agent may:

- Read versioned process instructions, setup files, stages, workflows, and references.
- Use ignored runtime paths under `workspace/` for project configuration, documentation, artwork, templates, and the active mod.
- Follow the shared guidelines, approved setup, selected workflow, active stage, and project glossary when present.
- Record project-specific vocabulary in `workspace/documentation/glossary.md` when it affects requirements, architecture, code naming, configuration, or public copy.
- Record workflow friction, corrections, and improvement ideas in `workspace/documentation/workflow-feedback.md` when they arise.
- Modify mod source only in the active repository under `workspace/project/`.
- Treat `workspace/template/` as disposable source material.

During a mod project, the agent must not:

- Modify versioned process files such as `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `guidelines/`, `stages/`, `workflows/`, `setup/`, or `references/`.
- Treat `workflow-feedback.md` as approval to change this repository.
- Switch into a process-maintenance mode inside this workspace.
- Commit or push changes to the outer process repository.
- Modify a nested mod repository while supposedly changing the process repository.

Workflow feedback is only a project artifact. It exists so the project owner can later share concrete feedback with a separate process-improvement session or another agent outside the active mod-development workflow.

If the user asks to improve this workflow while a mod project is active, record the request in `workspace/documentation/workflow-feedback.md` and explain that process-repository changes should be handled separately from the mod project.

## Repository Boundaries

- **Process material:** versioned instructions, defaults, stages, workflows, and references. Read-only during mod development.
- **Runtime workspace:** ignored project-specific state under `workspace/`.
- **Template workspace:** an ignored clone under `workspace/template/`; never the development target.
- **Project documentation:** ignored artifacts under `workspace/documentation/`.
- **Mod repository:** exactly one independent Git repository under `workspace/project/<mod-name>/`.

Do not copy template Git metadata into the mod repository. If there is no active mod repository, Project Setup and the selected workflow determine whether one will be initialized or cloned. If more than one exists, ask which one is active.

## Project Setup

Before selecting the first workflow, inspect the workspace for:

```text
workspace/documentation/project-setup.md
```

If no approved setup artifact exists, run `stages/0-project-setup.md`.

Do not tell the user to read the README or configure the project alone. Inspect what is already available, explain the immediate decision, ask one focused question at a time, and guide the user through setup.

An approved setup may be carried forward. Revisit Project Setup when the active repository, scenario, template candidate, required environment, or operational configuration materially changes.

## Workflow Selection

After Project Setup, inspect `project-status.md`, repository state, approved setup, and approved baseline artifacts.

Select exactly one workflow:

| Condition | Workflow |
| --- | --- |
| An active workflow is recorded | Resume that workflow |
| No implementation or approved baseline exists | `workflows/initial-development.md` |
| An existing implementation has no approved process baseline | `workflows/existing-mod-assessment.md` |
| An approved baseline exists and a change is requested | `workflows/change-cycle.md` |

Present the selection and evidence before starting a new workflow. Do not classify an existing repository as empty initialization input or treat unapproved documents as a baseline. Ask when the state is ambiguous.

Record the approved workflow in `workspace/documentation/project-status.md`.

## Required Reading

For mod-development work, read in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. The core guideline files listed under **Instruction Ownership**
3. `workspace/documentation/project-status.md`, when present
4. `workspace/documentation/glossary.md`, when present
5. `workspace/documentation/workflow-feedback.md`, when present
6. `stages/0-project-setup.md` and its artifact when setup is required
7. The selected file under `workflows/`
8. The active stage under `stages/`, when the workflow invokes one
9. Any specialized guideline explicitly referenced by the active workflow or stage
10. The approved artifacts referenced by the workflow or stage
11. The relevant implementation issue and source code, when applicable

Do not silently resolve contradictions between sources. Follow `guidelines/process-control.md`.

## Instruction Ownership

- `guidelines/project-defaults.md`: stable defaults for every mod.
- `guidelines/process-control.md`: setup, workflow and stage status, approval, artifacts, project glossary, workflow feedback, and backward transitions.
- `guidelines/collaboration-guidelines.md`: communication, editing, Git authorization, workflow feedback behavior, and completion reporting.
- `guidelines/coding-standards.md`: implementation and verification conventions.
- Specialized guideline files under `guidelines/`: task-specific instructions read only when referenced.
- `workflows/*.md`: scenario-specific routing and behavior.
- `setup/manual-workspace-setup.md`: optional human-operated workspace configuration.
- `setup/initialize-project.md`: new-repository initialization procedure used later.
- `setup/glossary-template.md`: template for the project-specific glossary.
- `setup/workflow-feedback-template.md`: template for the project-specific feedback log.
- `stages/*.md`: setup and reusable development-stage responsibilities.

When instructions overlap, the file that owns the subject is authoritative. Other files should reference it instead of restating it.

## Execution

Complete or carry forward Project Setup, then resume or obtain approval for the applicable workflow. Follow one checkpoint or stage at a time, update `project-status.md`, maintain the project glossary when relevant, record workflow feedback when relevant, and stop whenever owner approval is required. Never advance automatically.
