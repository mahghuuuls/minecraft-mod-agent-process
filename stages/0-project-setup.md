# Project Setup

## Purpose

Prepare the process workspace, establish the project scenario, and guide the project owner through the operational decisions required to begin the correct workflow.

This stage is interactive onboarding. It does not define mod behavior, prove technical feasibility, initialize a final codebase, or implement features.

## Main Question

> Is the workspace sufficiently configured to begin the correct workflow, with later prerequisites understood and assigned?

## Required Input

- The project owner's initial request
- `guidelines/project-defaults.md`
- `setup/template-defaults.properties`
- `setup/project.properties.example`
- `references/template-candidates.md`
- Existing `workspace/project.properties`, when present
- Existing workspace documents and repositories, when present

## Objectives

Establish:

- Whether the user is creating, assessing, or changing a mod
- The proposed workflow
- The current tool and workspace state
- The project repository state or the stage by which it must exist
- A provisional loader, compatible-runtime, and template choice for Initial Development
- Approved distribution platforms and known operational overrides
- Release-related ownership boundaries for the project owner and agent
- Deferred prerequisites and their deadlines
- A clear starting point requiring no README knowledge

## In Scope

- Explain the workspace and agent-guided process briefly
- Inspect existing configuration and repositories
- Check available Git and Java installations
- Record IntelliJ IDEA availability or installation as a pending prerequisite
- Create required ignored runtime directories
- Create or update `workspace/project.properties` when enough real values are known
- Explain the shared platform preferences and available loader/template choices
- Research loader and template candidates when requested or unresolved
- Record provisional loader, runtime, and template candidates or defer final validation to Feasibility Research
- Explain repository requirements for the selected scenario
- Collect and approve the release ownership matrix
- Propose the applicable workflow
- Produce `workspace/documentation/project-setup.md`

## Out of Scope

Do not:

- Define features or detailed mod behavior
- Conclude that the concept is technically feasible
- Perform architecture design
- Clone or copy a template into the final project
- Initialize the final mod repository
- Modify existing mod source
- Create commits or push
- Create a GitHub repository or modify an external service without separate explicit authorization
- Require a new-mod repository before Concept and Scope begins
- Research upload procedures, publication page setup, or external platform mechanics unless the owner explicitly assigns that work to the agent
- Write fake placeholder values into machine-readable configuration

## Desired AI Behavior

Act as an onboarding coordinator.

- Inspect before asking questions.
- Do not direct the user back to the README.
- Explain only the immediate setup decision.
- Ask one focused question at a time.
- Distinguish required-now values from prerequisites that may be deferred.
- Offer the configured default before researching alternatives.
- Explain trade-offs when presenting template candidates.
- Record uncertainty instead of guessing.
- Preserve existing repositories and unrelated workspace content.
- Treat owner-managed responsibilities as hard boundaries unless the owner explicitly changes them.
- Present the setup result and proposed workflow for explicit approval.

## Scenario Classification

Classify exactly one scenario:

### New Mod

Use when no implementation or approved baseline exists.

- Propose Initial Development.
- Explain that an empty final GitHub repository is required before Project Initialization, not before Concept and Scope.
- Collect repository URL and directory name now only when the owner already has them.
- Otherwise record them as deferred prerequisites due before Project Initialization.

### Existing Mod Assessment

Use when implementation or release history exists without an approved process baseline.

- Propose Existing Mod Assessment.
- Require the existing repository identity before assessment begins.
- Preserve its history and never apply the empty-repository rule.

### Change to an Approved Mod

Use when an approved baseline exists and another feature, fix, compatibility update, or refactor is requested.

- Propose Change Cycle.
- Confirm that the configured repository and baseline still identify the intended mod.
- Reuse approved setup unless operational configuration changed.

If evidence is insufficient to classify the scenario, ask rather than choosing silently.

## Environment Inspection

Inspect and record:

- Operating system
- Git availability and version
- Java availability and version
- IntelliJ IDEA availability when it can be determined
- Existing process-repository status
- Existing runtime directories
- Existing nested repositories
- Existing configuration and setup artifacts

Project defaults define the intended environment. Missing tools may be installed later when they are not needed by the first stage, but record the stage by which each is required.

Do not install software without explicit authorization.

## Template Guidance

For Initial Development:

1. Read `references/template-candidates.md`.
2. Ask whether the artifact must run on standard Forge, Cleanroom, or both.
3. Ask whether Java, Kotlin, or Scala is intended.
4. Identify required build capabilities such as Mixins, coremods, access transformers, tests, shadowing, or advanced automation.
5. Inspect the current candidate repositories and primary documentation.
6. Present a concise comparison and recommendation.
7. Record the provisional repository, ref, compatibility target, trade-offs, and evidence.
8. Store approved project-specific values in `workspace/project.properties`.

Use this recommendation order unless inspected evidence or project constraints justify another choice:

1. **ForgeDevEnv:** recommended default for broad Forge and Cleanroom compatibility.
2. **CleanroomModTemplate:** specialized choice for Cleanroom-exclusive development.
3. **GregTechCEu Buildscripts:** advanced choice for projects that need its managed build and automation.
4. **TemplateDevEnvKt:** language-specific alternative for Kotlin.
5. **Another researched candidate:** only when the maintained shortlist does not fit.

Do not select CleanroomModTemplate merely because Cleanroom compatibility is desired. A conventional Forge artifact is normally the broader compatibility target; CleanroomModTemplate is appropriate when Cleanroom-native or Java 25-only behavior is intentional.

Do not recommend archived, unlicensed, experimental, or multiversion templates without explaining their risk and proving that they support the approved Minecraft 1.12.2 target.

Template choice remains provisional until Feasibility Research validates it. Do not clone or prototype templates during this stage.

Existing Mod Assessment and Change Cycle begin from the existing loader and build system, but Stage 0 must still record supported runtimes and intended distribution platforms.

## Release Ownership Matrix

Collect an ownership matrix before approving Project Setup. This matrix defines which release-related responsibilities are agent-managed, owner-managed, shared, or deferred.

Use these owner values:

- **Agent:** The agent may perform the work within the approved workflow.
- **Owner:** The project owner performs the work. The agent may record the decision and provide only specifically requested help.
- **Shared:** The agent prepares material, but the owner performs final selection, execution, or external action.
- **Deferred:** The responsibility is intentionally postponed. Record the stage or condition that will revisit it.

Start from these defaults unless the owner changes them:

| Area | Default Owner | Default Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| README | Agent | Prepare player-facing public copy unless another documentation style is approved. |
| Changelog | Agent | Prepare concise player-facing release notes from approved changes. |
| Icon | Owner | Do not research, generate, or select an icon unless the owner explicitly assigns icon work to the agent. |
| Screenshots | Agent | Prepare screenshot guidance, captions, or checklist when useful; owner may still capture final screenshots. |
| CurseForge upload | Owner | Do not research upload mechanics, publication page setup, or final platform field choices unless explicitly assigned. |
| Release JAR generation | Agent | Generate or identify the normal release artifact only when later stages keep this agent-managed. |
| Final publication verification | Agent | Verify approved local handoff information by default; external publication checks require owner-provided context or explicit approval. |
| Dedicated server testing | Owner | Do not attempt, research, or repeatedly request dedicated server validation unless explicitly assigned. |
| Cleanroom testing | Agent | Validate or record limitations when the approved runtime target requires it and the environment supports it. |
| External multiplayer testing | Owner | Do not attempt, research, or repeatedly request external multiplayer validation unless explicitly assigned. |

When asking about the matrix, present the defaults first and ask what the owner wants to override. Do not ask every row as a separate question unless the owner wants detailed control.

Record the approved matrix in `workspace/documentation/project-setup.md`. Later stages must follow it. If a later stage needs to perform owner-managed work, stop and ask the owner to revise the matrix or approve a one-time exception.

## Project Configuration

Use:

```text
workspace/project.properties
```

Only write values that are known and approved.

Relevant values may include:

- `project_repository_url`
- `project_directory_name`
- `mod_loader`
- `supported_runtimes`
- `distribution_platforms`
- `template_repository_url`
- `template_repository_ref`
- `root_package`
- `mod_authors`
- `minecraft_username`
- `preferred_development_java_version`
- `target_java_version`
- `project_default_branch`
- `use_modern_java_syntax`
- `license`

Shared defaults remain in `setup/template-defaults.properties`. Do not edit shared defaults during mod development.

If a new mod's repository or directory name is deferred, do not create an invalid properties file merely to complete the stage. Record the missing values and their deadline in the setup artifact.

## Process

1. Read the shared defaults and inspect the workspace.
2. Explain that setup can be completed interactively.
3. Identify the scenario.
4. Inspect available environment tools and repositories.
5. Resolve known repository configuration.
6. Resolve or provisionally defer loader, runtime, template, and distribution selections.
7. Present the release ownership defaults and collect approved overrides.
8. Write only approved known operational values.
9. Record deferred prerequisites and the stage by which each is required.
10. Propose the applicable workflow.
11. Produce the setup artifact.
12. Present the artifact and workflow selection for separate explicit approval.

## Output Artifact

Produce:

```text
workspace/documentation/project-setup.md
```

It should contain:

1. Setup date
2. Classified scenario and evidence
3. Proposed workflow
4. Environment inspection
5. Repository state
6. Configuration written
7. Provisional loader, runtime, template, and distribution decisions with evidence
8. Release ownership matrix
9. Deferred prerequisites and deadlines
10. Blocking problems
11. Owner approvals

Do not include credentials or secrets.

## Completion Criteria

This stage is complete when:

- The scenario is supported by inspected evidence and owner confirmation.
- The proposed workflow is explicit.
- Required-now operational values are configured.
- Future prerequisites have explicit deadlines.
- The loader, runtime, template, and distribution decisions are recorded or legitimately deferred/not applicable.
- The release ownership matrix is recorded and approved.
- No unresolved blocker prevents the selected workflow's first stage.
- `project-setup.md` is approved.
- The project owner separately approves the proposed workflow.

Completion permits the selected workflow to begin. It does not approve any development stage.
